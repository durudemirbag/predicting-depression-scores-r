# Predicting Depression Scores Using Linear Regression 

This repository contains a statistical analysis project focused on predicting adolescent depression scores using linear regression techniques in R.

The project analyses survey data collected from adolescents in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia, with the aim of identifying key factors associated with depression and evaluating model performance through appropriate statistical methods.

## Project Context

This project was completed as part of an **MSc Data Science group project** and is shared here to demonstrate skills in statistical modelling, data analysis, and result interpretation using R.

## Methodology

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Variable selection techniques (subset selection, backward elimination)
- Interaction terms and polynomial transformations
- Model diagnostics and assumption checks
- Model evaluation using RMSE and R²

## Requirements

- R
- caret
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- GGally
- leaps
- patchwork
- rpart

## Repository Structure

- `data.csv` : Dataset used for the analysis  
- `appendix_code.R` : R script containing the full analysis  
- `Project.pdf` : Final written report including methodology, results, and interpretation
